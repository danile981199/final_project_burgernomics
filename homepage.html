    <h2>Project Insights</h2>
    <p>
    For our project, we created a visualization to explore how the Big Mac Index relates to other economic indicators and look at the changes over time across countries around the world.
    </p>
    <p>
    For those who don’t know, the Big Mac Index is a metric created by the Economist that is based on purchasing power parity, or the idea that exchange rates over time should move towards equality across national borders in the price charged for an identical basket of goods, in this case, a McDonalds Big Mac. Unlike a basket of goods or groceries, which looks very different in composition around the world, a Big Mac is mostly the same. However, as we will find with the data, the price does not always reflect that.  
    </p>
    <p>
    We want our visualization to serve as an exploratory tool to allow users who don’t have a ton of background in finance to gain some insight into these indices. The goal of the Big Mac Index is to make exchange-rate theory more digestible, so we wanted to stay true to that mission here. Our goal is for users to come away from our visualization knowing even just a little bit more about an aspect of this data that they find most interesting.  
    </p>
    <p>
    To make our visualization, we reviewed papers proposing applications of data vis to finances, and learned the importance of keeping the search tools simple and intuitive while giving users the options to explore the information how they want. The map view allows people to view the current values of the indices around the world quickly, and hover for more detailed information. The indices we chose to highlight in addition to the Big Mac index were GDP per capita, Unemployment Rate, and Literacy Rate. Users also have the option to view changes in these values over time and compare data from two countries side-by side.
